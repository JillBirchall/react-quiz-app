# Description

A trivia quiz with a choice of categories, difficulties and number of questions. The category list is dynamically generated from the API. The maximum number of questions is 50, or the maximum number of questions available for that category if lower. 

Each question has a 15 second timer, and the score awarded for the correct answer varies depending on the time left on the timer:

0 to 5 seconds: 10 points
6 to 10 seconds: 20 points
11 to 15 seconds: 30 points

After an answer is clicked, it is highlighted in green if it is the correct answer, otherwise it is highlighted in red. If an incorrect answer is selected, the correct answer flashes in green. The score increment will also be shown for any question answered correctly. 

The final score is displayed at the end of the quiz, with an option to play again.

This app also features a loader and an error message is displayed in cases where data cannot be retrieved from the API for any reason.

The questions used in this quiz are taken from the Open Trivia DB API. These questions are licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
